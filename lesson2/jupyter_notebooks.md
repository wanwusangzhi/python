# jupyter notebooks

## install
```
conda install jupyter notebook
```

## launching the notebook server
* To start a notebook server, enter jupyter notebook in your terminal or console. This will start the server in the directory you ran the command in. That means any notebook files will be saved in that directory.
```
```

## manage environment
* Then if you run the notebook server from a conda environment, you'll also have access to the "Conda" tab shown below. Here you can manage your environments from within Jupyter. You can create new environments, install packages, update packages, export environments and more.
```
conda install nb_conda
```
